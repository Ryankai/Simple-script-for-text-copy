# Simple-script-for-text-copy
This script can remove the carriage return in the text from clipboard.

In my research, I always need to copy text from PDF files. In some situations, the line breaker makes thing complicated. So I wrote this scrit. It can automatically detect text copied to clipcoard and remove all carriage return.

How to run script:
1. download "text.py"
2. open termianl and cd to destination folder
3. run file. (I'm running on Windows so the command is "python text.py")

P.S. My code is running on Win OS. If you are running linux or MacOS, the code needed to be updataed.
